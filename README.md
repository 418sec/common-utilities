# Common Utilities

This repository contains common utilities for javascript development.

These methods are used and written elsewhere ([LoDash](https://lodash.com/), [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/docs/)). This repository is beneficial to me and may be beneficial to others because it documents common JavaScript utilities functions for those that are learning them.
